<div><p1>Kim Jong-un (Chosŏn'gŭl: 김정은; Korean pronunciation: [kim.dʑʌŋ.ɯn]; born 8 January 1982–84 or 5 July 1984) is
    the Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) and supreme leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
    (DPRK), commonly referred to as North Korea. Kim is the second child of Kim Jong-il (1941–2011) and Ko Yong-hui.
    Before taking power, Kim was rarely seen in public, and many of the activities of Kim and his government remain
    unknown. Even details such as what year he was born, and whether he did indeed attend a Western school under a
    pseudonym, are difficult to confirm.</p1></div>
    <div><p> </p></div>
<div><p2>Kim was declared the supreme leader following the state funeral of his father on 28 December 2011. Kim holds the
    titles of Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea, Chairman of the Central Military Commission, Chairman of
    the State Affairs Commission, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and presidium member of
    the Politburo Standing Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea. Kim was promoted to the rank of Marshal of
    North Korea in the Korean People's Army on 18 July 2012, consolidating his position as the Supreme Commander of
    the Armed Forces[10] and is often referred to as Marshal Kim Jong-un or "the Marshal" by state media.
    Kim obtained two degrees, one in physics at Kim Il-sung University, and another as an Army officer at the
    Kim Il-sung Military University.</p2></div>
